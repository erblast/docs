# IDE vs Shell
So far I was not happy with all the IDEs (Rstudio/Gitkraken/Github desktop) that I have tested. They provide some convenient shortcuts but in the end they tended to screw things up for me. That is why I am writing this documentation.

## Advantages of IDEs
IDEs are mcuh better at visualizing the branches and the commits. They are also much better for resolving merge conflicts (gitkraken).

## Disadvantages of IDEs
You are always missing a functionality that makes you switch to the Shell. It is better to be literate with the shell commands all together to speed up your workflow.

# The git repository
The git repository is your project folder, it contains some hidden files and folders that are used by git to track your commits and the branches. If you run git and open your repository you can set the folder to mirror commits or branches. This will actually change the files that you can find with your system explorer.

# Setup your git repository (when using a remote repository)
Git gets tricky if you have multiple users or if you synchronize with a remote repository. You constantly have to consider which branch you are in and if you have commited everything and pulled before commit and pushed and merged. It is complicated. To reduce the complexity I would try to do everything you can in the remote repository GUI. On github this means creating the repository itself and all branches directly on github. This means that you do not have to worry about connecting local branches and reposiotries to the remote repository.

## clone a repository

open the directory you want to clone the repository in right click and select `git bash here`

```{}
git clone https://github.com/erblast/oetteR.git
```
## .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file contains a list of filenames that will be ignored and not and not tracked by git. When you are starting a git project it easy to skip this important file. It is however crucial to set it up before you start coding away. Once you are already deep in the project your workflow will be seriously disturbed when you keep having to do commits for file changes that you cannot control (for example `thumbs.db`) or have to resolve merge conflicts in outputfiles of your code such as `*.pdf` and `*.html` files. You will find that adding filenames to `.gitignore` that are already tracked will not work. You have to tediously add them manually in your git bash shell.

### setting up `.gitignore`

- Creating your git project with Rstudio will already add some R/Rstudio files to `.gitignore`.  
- [Here](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/R.gitignore) you can find a useful list of files to be added for R projects.  

### Untracking files in hindsight

**untracking a single file**    
```{}
git rm --cached [file_name]
```

**untracking all files in a directory** 
```{}
git rm --cached inst/\*
```

**untrack all files of a certain type**  
```{}
git rm -r --cached **/*.html
```

# Navigating in the shell

**switch between branches**
remember you create them only in the remote/origin repository
```{}
git checkout branch
```

**what's going on?**
Carefull the status is not always up to date. It seems to not check if the branch was updated from somewhere else than the current computer. It hapenned several times that the reply to the command implied that the current branch is up-to-date with the origin branch but then a pull command would still retrieve changes.
```{}
git status
```
# workflow
This is the workflow that currently works best for me. My setup is two computers that I use two write on the same R package.

**Principles:**
- each computer gets its own fork, committing is restricted to only that branch
- at the beginning of each session the whole repository including all branches is pulled
- the working branch is rebased (the master branch is merged into the working branch)
- at the end of each session the working branch is merged into master
- push all branches

## Pull

**Pull all**
this would be nice to have but it DOES NOT WORK, it fetches from all branches but MERGES ONLY THE ACTIVE BRANCH.
```{}
git pull --all
```
**pull active branch**
```{}
git pull
```

## commit
Use `git status` to see a if there are any changes to commit. Commit as often as you like, give resonable namings to you commits. A commit will not work if you do not supply a commit message. Git will let you rollback to any commit you made. Always use the `-m "text"` operator when calling `git commit`, otherwise you will end up will display confusing commit screen.

```{}
git commit -m "enter message here"
```

### if you see the confusing commit screen
you forgot to type `-m "text"`

**hit `ESC` **
```{}
:wq
```
### git started tracking changes that are meaningless and annoy me
reset all changes
```{}
git reset HEAD --hard
```
### i screwed up and made some stupid commits that i want to remove
**Opt1: roll back to remote branch version**
```{}
git reset --hard origin/workbranch
```
## Push
Push local commits to remote

```{}
git push
```

Overwrite remote version
```{}
git push origin branch_name -f
```

## Rebase
rebase to update your work branch from master DO NOT FORGET MASTER in the command. Your branch will not fully merge and stuff will be missing and you will get merge conflicts.
**rebase active branch**
```{}
git rebase master
```
## Merge
Merging can be the most annoying part of using git, I tend to have merge conflicts all the time and they are annoying to resolve. I will have an extra section on this further down.

**merge branch into master**
```{}
git checkout master
git merge work_branch
```
## Merge conflicts
Those are tedious to resolve and eat up time that could better be spent coding. If you have them use `git status` to see whats wrong. Open the files with an editor and find the highlighted conflicting code and edit it. (remove the highlights inserted by git and keep the code that is correct). If there is an delete you can either add `git add filename` or remove (`git rm filename`). I think it is best to use this manual approach for a while and develope a disciplined git workflow that makes you avoid these all together. Then when you think you got it right switch to gitkraken to handle your merge conflicts.

## Restore old commit versions
Checkout commit history of a certain branch 
```{}
git log master

git revert 2342jk23l4jl2hg23k4j2h34
```
