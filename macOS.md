# Transitioning from windows to MacOS

Here I will document some usefull shortcuts for MacOS

## Tools

### Magnet
Allows windows like grid layout on mac. [link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12)

### Gitbash for Mac
Makes the terminal window look like the git bash shell in windows. The advantage is that the command line indicates
which branch of the git repository you are in. [link](https://github.com/fabriziocucci/git-bash-for-mac)

## Shortcuts

The keyboard layout is a bit weird some characters are just not on my keyboard. We can find a lot of the special
characters in the menu bar. `edit` -> `emoji and symbols`

- <kbd>⌥ + 5 </kbd> and <kbd>⌥ + 6 </kbd> -> `[]`
- <kbd> + N </kbd>  -> `~`
- <kbd> ⌘ + ⇧ + 4 </kbd>  -> `screenshot tool`
- <kbd> ⌘ + → </kbd>  -> `end of line`
- <kbd> ⌘ + ← </kbd>  -> `start of line`
