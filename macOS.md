# Transitioning from windows to MacOS

Here I will document some usefull shortcuts for MacOS

## Tools

### Magnet
Allows windows like grid layout on mac. [link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12)

### Gitbash for Mac

#set default bash to bin/bash*

Makes the terminal window look like the git bash shell in windows. The advantage is that the command line indicates
which branch of the git repository you are in. [link](https://github.com/fabriziocucci/git-bash-for-mac)

in case conda was previously installed copy conda section from .zshrc into .bash_profile

create file .inputrc

with

```
# ~/.inputrc
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward
```

### Add copy to path feature
In windows we are used to copying the path of a file via shift + right click menu. With a mac we need to create the featue using the `automator` which is some kind of macro builder. The procedure is described [here](http://osxdaily.com/2013/06/19/copy-file-folder-path-mac-os-x/)

## Shortcuts

The keyboard layout is a bit weird some characters are just not on my keyboard. We can find a lot of the special
characters in the menu bar. `edit` -> `emoji and symbols`

- <kbd>⌥ + 5 </kbd> and <kbd>⌥ + 6 </kbd> -> `[]`
- <kbd> ⌥ + N </kbd>  -> `~`
- <kbd> ⌥ + 7 </kbd>  -> `|`
- <kbd> ⌥ + ⇧ + 7 </kbd>  -> `\`
- <kbd> ⌘ + ⇧ + 4 </kbd>  -> `screenshot tool`
- <kbd> ⌘ + → </kbd>  -> `end of line`
- <kbd> ⌘ + ← </kbd>  -> `start of line`
