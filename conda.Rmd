# `conda`
This is a compilation of a few terminal commands for managing different python environments using `conda`, with a brief introduction also pointing to the alternatives of `conda` environments. As a disclaimer I will use `conda` as a synonyme `anaconda`, the former is the abbreviated command you use inside your terminal.

## Introduction Code Reproducibility

Every code has a couple of dependencies that limit its reproducibility/portability

### Hard-coded dependencies
These are the obvious dependencies which are easily avoided by adhering to good coding practices.

- file paths
- random numbers or randomized code outcome

### Software dependencies
 Often your code will not run on another machine even if code and underlying data source have not been changed because of variations in the installation of the programming languages that you have been using. A typical data science project can depend on a number of installations on your machine. To name a few of them

- `R` *
- `R packages` *
- `python` *
- `python packages` *
- `pip`
- `git`
- `Java`
- `a C++ compiler`
- `pandoc`
- `latex`
- `phantom js`

The most important being `R` and `python` and the underlying packages which usually shoulder the workload of your code.

### System/Hardware dependencies
Then there is you machine in itself which has a specific get up:

- OS (32bit, 64bit)
- environment variable
- Hardware (number of cores, RAM, GPU)



### Programming language-based solutions
There are a number of strategies to reproducibly preserve either your `python` or your `R` environment. For R there is `packrat` and `checkpoint` and for `python` there is the `pip freeze` command, which preserves all packages and version in a `requirements.txt` file.

However these solutions are focused on snapshotting the programming language environment and do not consider any of the other tools and system configurations that might be necessary to run your code. 

### Environment-based solutions (`anaconda`)
`conda` environmnents use a bit of a more holistic approach, they too are focused on your programming language and the packages that are installed with it, but they provide a strategy for handling `R` and `python` simultaneously and they have a set of packages for which they offer their own support for. Meaning you can download the packages from a `conda` server and they are garanteed to be compatible with each other as long as they are being installed at the same time. However the `conda` environments are not garanteed to be platform independent. The list of supported packages depends on the OS. However anaconda will make an effort to replicate the environment as closely as possible.

### Container-based solutions
The state of the art solution is a `docker` container, which containerizes everything (tools, drivers, environment variables, etc), this eases pushing code into procuction  as explained [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/docker-data-science/). There are even solutions for systems with specialized hardware configurations such as GPUs, as explained [here](https://indico.io/data-science-deployments-docker/)

# Managing `anaconda` environments

## `anaconda` navigator GUI

after installing the anaconda distribution you can run the navigator app, which allows you to create environments and manage
the installed packages. As always with these tools some commands will only work in the command line.

# Command Line 

condensated version of official [documentation](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#removing-an-environment)

## Check installation
```
conda --version
```

## Create an environment
that contains `python` and `R`
```
conda create --name myenv python - r
```


## Activate environment
will add your environment to your command line
```
conda activate myenv
```
## Deactivate environment
will remove your environment from your command line

```
conda deactivate
```
## Remove an environment
```
conda remove -name myenv --all
```

## Install packages

### Install packages from anaconda servers
here I included a sensible collection of data science packages, including tools such as pip and rstudio
```
conda install pandas pytest pytest-doctestplus plotly matplotlib numpy seaborn scipy statsmodels r-essentials pip rstudio
```

## List packages

### environment activated
```
conda list
```

### environment not activated
```
conda list -name myenv
```

### is package installed in an environment
```
conda list -name myenv pandas
```
### exporting an environment to share
activate the environment that you want to export. It will save a `.yml` file into the current working directory
```
conda env export myenv.yml
```
