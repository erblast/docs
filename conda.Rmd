# `conda`
This is a compilation of a few terminal commands for managing different python environments using `conda`, with a brief introduction also pointing to the alternatives of `conda` environments. As a disclaimer I will use `conda` as a synonyme `anaconda`, the former is the abbreviated command you use inside your terminal.

## Introduction Code Reproducibility

Every code has a couple of dependencies that limit its reproducibility/portability

### Hard-coded dependencies
These are the obvious dependencies which are easily avoided by adhering to good coding practices.

- file paths
- random numbers or randomized code outcome

### Software dependencies
 Often your code will not run on another machine even if code and underlying data source have not been changed because of variations in the installation of the programming languages that you have been using. A typical data science project can depend on a number of installations on your machine. To name a few of them

- `R` *
- `R packages` *
- `python` *
- `python packages` *
- `pip`
- `git`
- `Java`
- `a C++ compiler`
- `pandoc`
- `latex`
- `phantom js`

The most important being `R` and `python` and the underlying packages which usually shoulder the workload of your code.

### System/Hardware dependencies
Then there is you machine in itself which has a specific get up:

- OS (32bit, 64bit)
- environment variable
- Hardware (number of cores, RAM, GPU)



### Programming language-based solutions
There are a number of strategies to reproducibly preserve either your `python` or your `R` environment. For R there is `packrat` and `checkpoint` and for `python` there is the `pip freeze` command, which preserves all packages and version in a `requirements.txt` file.

However these solutions are focused on snapshotting the programming language environment and do not consider any of the other tools and system configurations that might be necessary to run your code. 

### Environment-based solutions (`anaconda`)
`conda` environmnents use a bit of a more holistic approach, they too are focused on your programming language and the packages that are installed with it, but they provide a strategy for handling `R` and `python` simultaneously and they have a set of packages for which they offer their own support for. Meaning you can download the packages from a `conda` server and they are garanteed to be compatible with each other as long as they are being installed at the same time. However the `conda` environments are not garanteed to be platform independent. The list of supported packages depends on the OS. However anaconda will make an effort to replicate the environment as closely as possible.

### Container-based solutions
The state of the art solution is a `docker` container, which containerizes everything (tools, drivers, environment variables, etc), this eases pushing code into procuction  as explained [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/docker-data-science/). There are even solutions for systems with specialized hardware configurations such as GPUs, as explained [here](https://indico.io/data-science-deployments-docker/)

# Managing `anaconda` environments

## `anaconda` navigator GUI

after installing the anaconda distribution you can run the navigator app, which allows you to create environments and manage
the installed packages. As always with these tools some commands will only work in the command line.

# Command Line 

condensated version of official [documentation](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#removing-an-environment)

## Check installation
```
conda --version
```

## Create an environment
that contains `python` and `R`
```
conda create --name myenv python=3.6 r=3.4.1
```


## Activate environment
will add your environment to your command line
```
conda activate myenv
```
## Deactivate environment
will remove your environment from your command line

```
conda deactivate
```
## Remove an environment
```
conda remove -name myenv --all
```

## Install packages and apps

### Channels
An important issue for `anaconda` are the channels where we can find tha packages that we want to install in our `anaconda` environments. Each environment contains a list of channels which will be searched from top to bottom for a package that we would like to install. `anaconda` will always prioritize the channel over the version number thus might not always install the latest versions. Each environment starts with the channel `defaults` which are the official channels

##### Add a channel to the bottom of the list
You want to make sure that the defaults channels rank high thus I recommend appending all new channels.
```
conda config --append channels conda-forge bioconductor
```

##### Add a channel to the top of the list
here you want to add your own channel containing your anaconda builds. 
```
conda config --prepend channels anaconda_username
```

### Install packages without build/compilation

*make sure the environment that you want to install to is active*

*we can install apps such as Rstudio, pip, etc (see anaconda launcher with the same synthax)*

##### from listed channel
```
conda install package_name
```

#### from pip
```
conda install pip
pip install package_name
pip install git+repos_url
```

### Install packages with build/compilation

We need to downlaod the source code of the package, then compile it using `anaconda` and upload it to a public channel. 

#### Create an anaconda account and login



### Install packages from external sources
This is where it gets complicated and where the situation is different for `R` and `python`. We could simply install packages from other sources (github, CRAN) manually in `R` (`install.packages()` or `devtools`) but `anaconda` will not track them and thus the environment will not be reproducible. 

**If available always use anaconda sources, however they are often outdated.**

We can easily find them by googeling the package name together with `anaconda`. **For python packages it is easier we can simply pip install them and the installation will be tracked given that the `anaconda` environment is activated.**

### Install packages that need to be built/compiled
This includes all packages from github/ CRAN/ self-developments. Some of them will nee

#### CRAN

this will download the repository to your current work directory
```
conda skeleton cran r-xgboost
```

```
conda skeleton cran r-xgboost
conda build r-xgboost
conda install --use-local r-xgboost
```

### Upload builds to `anaconda`
make sure to create an `anaconda` account first.

```
anaconda login
conda build r-xgboost
conda config --set anaconda_upload yes
anaconda logout

```

## None standard channels

conda config --append channels conda-forge
conda config --append channels bioconda

**If available always use anaconda sources**

## List packages

### environment activated
```
conda list
```

### environment not activated
```
conda list -name myenv
```

### is package installed in an environment
```
conda list -name myenv pandas
```
### exporting an environment to share
activate the environment that you want to export. It will save a `.yml` file into the current working directory
```
conda env export -f myenv.yml
```
